/*
This technique is usually used when we inspect an important event and 
want to inspect the impact before and after a certain point in time.

Taking the week_date value of 2020-06-15 as the baseline week where 
the Data Mart sustainable packaging changes came into effect.

We would include all week_date values for 2020-06-15 as the start of 
the period after the change and the previous week_date values would be before

Using this analysis approach - answer the following questions:
    What is the total sales for the 4 weeks before and after 2020-06-15? 
    What is the growth or reduction rate in actual values and percentage of sales?
    
    What about the entire 12 weeks before and after?
    
    How do the sale metrics for these 2 periods before and after 
    compare with the previous years in 2018 and 2019?
